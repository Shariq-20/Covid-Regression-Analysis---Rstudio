# Covid Regression Analysis - Rstudio

# Welcome to My Covid Regression Analysis Repository!

 
Question 1 - London bike hires and covid restrictions – 50% of the Grade 
This section uses data from the (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires) London bike hire scheme 
and about COVID restrictions 
(https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/covid-19-restrictions-timeseries). 

We are interested in the effect upon bike hire usage as a result of three elements of the COVID 
response: Work From Home, Rule of 6 Indoors, and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.  
Use the data provided to perform regression analyses that examine the effect of these elements upon 
the number of bike rentals. You should also explore whether it is appropriate to control for the effect 
of potential differences between different years, months, and days of the week. 

Question 2 – Book Sales – 50% of the Grade 

This question asks you to examine data from an e-book a publishing company. 
The data provided contains information on e-book sales over a period of many months. Each row in 
the data represents one book. The values of the variables are taken across the entire time period, so 
daily.sales is the average number of sales (minus refunds) across all days in the period, and sale.price 
is the average price for which the book sold in the period. 
You should use this data to answer the following: 
Do books have more/fewer sales depending upon their average review scores and total number of 
reviews. 
What is the effect of sale price upon the number of sales, and is this different across genres?
